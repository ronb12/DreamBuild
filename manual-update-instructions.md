# Manual Update Instructions

The build process is failing due to timeout issues, so the latest changes to the Projects page aren't being deployed. Here are the solutions:

## Issue
- The build process (`npm run build`) is failing with `ETIMEDOUT: connection timed out` errors
- This means the latest changes to `src/pages/Projects.jsx` aren't being compiled into the built files
- The current `dist` folder contains an older version without the design updates

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Local Build Environment
1. **Restart your computer** - This often resolves timeout issues
2. **Clear Node.js cache**: `npm cache clean --force`
3. **Delete node_modules**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
4. **Try building again**: `npm run build`

### Option 2: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file
2. Let GitHub Actions handle the build and deployment
3. This bypasses local environment issues

### Option 3: Manual File Update (Temporary)
Since the build is failing, the changes we made to `src/pages/Projects.jsx` need to be manually applied to the built files, which is complex due to minification.

## Current Status
- ✅ Firebase deployment is working correctly
- ✅ Service worker cache updated to v2.9.0
- ❌ Build process failing due to timeout issues
- ❌ Latest design changes not included in built files

## What You Should See After Fix
- Projects page with 100px top padding (no overlap)
- Larger tab buttons matching header button size
- Modern card grid layout instead of list view
- Enhanced styling and animations

The deployment infrastructure is working - it's just the local build process that needs to be fixed.
