# Tetris Game Issue - Diagnostic Guide

## What's Not Working?

The user reported "the game is not fully functional". This could mean:

1. **Game doesn't start** - Start button not responding
2. **Pieces don't fall** - No animation/movement
3. **Controls don't work** - Arrow keys/rotation not responding
4. **Canvas not visible** - Black screen or no canvas
5. **Score not updating** - Lines clear but score doesn't change

## Generated Code Analysis

The Tetris code DreamBuild generated includes:

✅ **Complete Game Logic:**
- Block shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z pieces)
- Collision detection
- Rotation mechanics
- Line clearing algorithm
- Score tracking
- Game over detection

✅ **Controls:**
- Arrow Left/Right: Move piece
- Arrow Down: Fast drop
- Arrow Up / Space: Rotate
- Keyboard events bound

✅ **Game Loop:**
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation
- Time-based dropping (every 1000ms)
- Continuous redrawing

## Most Likely Issues:

### Issue #1: HTML Structure Missing Required Elements
**The JavaScript expects these IDs:**
- `game-canvas` - The canvas element
- `start-btn` - Start button
- `restart-btn` - Restart button
- `game-overlay` - Start screen
- `game-over` - Game over screen
- `score-display` - Score text
- `highscore-display` - High score text
- `final-score` - Final score on game over

**Solution:** Regenerate with explicit HTML requirements OR add missing IDs

### Issue #2: Canvas Not Initialized
**Symptoms:**
- Console error: "❌ Canvas not found!"
- Black preview or no game visible

**Solution:** Ensure canvas has correct ID and is in HTML

### Issue #3: Controls Not Binding
**Symptoms:**
- Pieces don't move when pressing keys
- Console shows "⚠️ Buttons not ready yet"

**Solution:** DOM might not be fully loaded - need proper initialization

## Recommended Fix

Tell DreamBuild: **"The tetris game isn't working. Please regenerate it making sure:"**
1. **The HTML has all required elements (canvas, buttons, score displays)**
2. **The canvas is properly sized and visible**
3. **Add console.log debugging to show when pieces fall**
4. **Make sure the game auto-starts or has a visible working Start button**
