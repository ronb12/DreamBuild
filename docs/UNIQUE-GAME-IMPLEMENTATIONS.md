- ✅ Score system (first to 5 points)
- ✅ Ball reset after scoring
- ✅ Win/lose conditions

**Code Size:** ~200 lines of custom Pong logic

**DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES:**
- 2-player mechanics vs single player
- AI opponent vs no AI

---

### 4. **BREAKOUT** - "build breakout"
**Unique Mechanics:**
- ✅ Brick grid system (5 rows × 10 columns)
- ✅ Brick collision and destruction
- ✅ Paddle-ball physics
- ✅ Mouse control support
- ✅ Multi-colored brick rows
- ✅ Win condition (all bricks destroyed)
- ✅ Lose condition (ball falls below paddle)

**Code Size:** ~250 lines of custom Breakout logic

**DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES:**
- Grid of destroyable objects vs single target
- Mouse control vs keyboard only
- Win/lose dual outcomes vs endless play

---

### 5. **FLAPPY BIRD** - "build flappy bird"
**Unique Mechanics:**
- ✅ Gravity physics simulation
- ✅ Jump/flap mechanics
- ✅ Procedural pipe generation
- ✅ Gap-based collision detection
- ✅ Click or spacebar control
- ✅ Scrolling obstacle system
- ✅ Score on pipe pass

**Code Size:** ~250 lines of custom Flappy Bird logic

**DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES:**
- Gravity + jumping vs free movement
- Procedural level generation vs static
- One-button control vs multi-key
- Vertical navigation vs horizontal

---

### 6. **SPACE INVADERS** - "build space invaders"
**Unique Mechanics:**
- ✅ Alien formation system (4 rows × 8 columns)
- ✅ Formation movement (side-to-side, descending)
- ✅ Player shooting system
- ✅ Alien AI shooting (random aliens fire back)
- ✅ Bullet collision detection (player vs aliens)
- ✅ Formation direction reversal at edges
- ✅ Win/lose conditions

**Code Size:** ~300 lines of custom Space Invaders logic

**DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES:**
- Dual shooting system (player + enemies)
- Formation-based AI vs individual entities
- Defensive gameplay vs offensive
- Multiple enemies vs obstacles

---

## 🤖 Adaptive Engine - For ANY Other Game

When you request a game NOT in the above list, DreamBuild uses an **adaptive generic engine** that:

1. **Analyzes the prompt** for keywords (shoot, collect, dodge, jump, match, race, etc.)
2. **Detects required mechanics** based on game description
3. **Generates appropriate game logic** using the detected mechanics
4. **Creates custom game loop** tailored to the game type

**Examples:**
- "build racing game" → Detects `race`, generates car movement and track
- "create platformer" → Detects `jump`, generates platforms and jumping
- "make puzzle game" → Detects `match`, generates tile matching

## 📊 Comparison: Each Game is UNIQUE

| Feature | Tetris | Snake | Pong | Breakout | Flappy | Space |
|---------|--------|-------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Movement Type** | Falling | Grid | Paddle | Paddle | Flying | Ship |
| **Primary Mechanic** | Rotation | Growing | Bouncing | Breaking | Jumping | Shooting |
| **Collision** | Blocks | Self | Ball | Bricks | Pipes | Bullets |
| **Physics** | Gravity | None | Bounce | Bounce | Gravity | None |
| **AI Opponent** | No | No | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Win Condition** | Endless | Endless | First to 5 | Clear all | Endless | Defeat all |
| **Control Style** | 4-key | 4-key | 2-key | 2-key/Mouse | 1-key | 2-key + shoot |

**Zero code overlap between games** - Each is a completely custom implementation!

## 🎯 How Detection Works

```javascript
// DreamBuild analyzes your prompt:
"build tetris" → Detects 'tetris' → generateTetrisGame()
"create snake" → Detects 'snake' → generateSnakeGame()
"make pong"    → Detects 'pong'  → generatePongGame()
"build breakout" → Detects 'breakout' → generateBreakoutGame()
"create flappy bird" → Detects 'flappy' → generateFlappyBirdGame()
"build space invaders" → Detects 'space' → generateSpaceInvadersGame()
"create racing game" → No specific match → generateAdaptiveGame()
```

Each generator returns **completely different JavaScript code** with unique:
- Game state management
- Physics simulation
- Collision detection algorithms
- Rendering logic
- Control schemes
- Win/lose conditions

## 🏆 Summary

### ✅ **PWA Features:**
Every game includes:
- `manifest.json` with custom gradient icons
- `sw.js` with offline support
- PWA meta tags for installation
- Service Worker registration

### ✅ **Button Functionality:**

- Deploy Now → Opens DeploymentPanel
- Connect GitHub → Opens GitHubIntegration
- Editor/Preview/Terminal → Tab switching

### ✅ **Unique Game Generation:**
- **6 specific game engines** with unique mechanics
- **1 adaptive engine** for unlimited other games
- **Zero template reuse** between game types
- **Each game is coded from scratch** based on its mechanics
