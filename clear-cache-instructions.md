2. **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+R`

## Method 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. **Chrome**: 
   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Firefox**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cache" and click "Clear Now"

## Method 3: Disable Cache (For Testing)
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Refresh the page

## Method 4: Incognito/Private Mode
Open the site in incognito/private mode:
- **Chrome**: `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
